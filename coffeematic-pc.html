          A coffee maker computer by Doug MacDowell artist
        </h2>

        <p class="description">
          Sometime during winter 2024, I found myself at a thrift store. I was
          staring at rows of appliances, wrapped in plastic and clinging to
          life, trying to answer one question: which of these is the right
          chassis for a retro gaming computer?
          <br /><br />
          Driving home, I took corners carefully, checking that the General
          Electric (GE) drip coffee maker I’d chosen was safe in the backseat.
          The coffee maker's given name was Coffeematic. Circa 1980, it is boxy
          yet athletic – unfazed by any considerations of future internet
          connectivity. Best, it is perfect for being hacked.
          <br /><br />
          Coffeematic is now Coffeematic PC – part gaming computer, part coffee
          maker. A newly synthesized machine percolating processes well beyond
          its original configuration.
          <span class="highlight"
            >Coffeematic PC is part of a lineage of coffee maker computers made
            since 2002</span
          >. I'll describe that fascinating lineage here, and how it inspired an
          art exhibition called <a href="Sparklines.html">Sparklines</a>
          where hand-drafted data visualizations accompany Coffeematic PC.
          <br />

          Profound and poetically articulated. Elegant and assertive. Highly
          scaleable with dynamic acceleration. No. These do not describe
          Coffeematic PC or its peers (one of those phrases describes a bottle
          of wine.) A custom built computer can be basic and functional, or an

          This is how Coffeematic PC works.
          <span class="highlight"
            >The computer is fully functional. The coffee maker is too</span
          >, it percolates Java like a regular coffee maker. Very hot Java.
          Computers usually use fans or liquid cooling systems to reduce heat.
          Coffeematic PC uses the hot Java it brews to heat? cool? caffeinate?
          the computer. A pump takes the hot, caffenated slurry (~90C/194F) and
          circulates it thru two radiators sitting on top of Coffeematic PC's
          crown -> down to a central processing unit (CPU) tucked within an ASUS
          M2NPV-VM motherboard snugly strapped to Coffeematic PC's back. Java
          continues through an artery returning to Coffeematic PC's caraffe. The
          process repeats until Java is integrated with the user or the machine
          is powered off.

          ↑ Coffeematic PC has a dedicated pump to aggressively dispense Java
          for user.

          CPU's are meant to be cool and Java hot.
          <span class="highlight"
            >Despite circulating hot Java, Coffeematic PC does not crash.</span
          >
          To understand more, I wrote command line code to gather data on
          Coffeematic PC every 5 seconds, and monitored Coffeematic PC for 75
          minutes. The graph below shows the results. The machine is just barely
          non-destructive.

            equilibrium. A warm 33C/91F - amazingly close to the temperature of
            the slurry that flows through you and me.</span

          An important part of this project is the lineage of coffee maker
          computers. Before discussing that,
          <span class="highlight"> this is how Coffeematic PC was made.</span>
          The build is a mix of discarded electronics and newly purchased
          hardware, pumps, and radiators. The motherboard, CPU, RAM, and
          graphics card are from the mid 2000's and were sourced from a
          recycling center. This is a parts list for Coffeematic PC.

          I spent about a month designing and building Coffeematic PC.
          <span class="highlight">The build traverses time</span>. The coffee
          maker is from the late 1970's, the motherboard, CPU, and graphics card
          from the 2000's, and the SSD, operating system, and hardware from the
          today's (2020's). The General Electric coffee maker needed only a
          minor repair of replacing a small vinyl tube that had cracked. It
          takes awhile to brew a pot of coffee, but once it is brewed... it
          tastes like coffee made from a plastic coffee maker from the 1970's.
          I'lllll drink it!

          I'm not the first person to synthesize a coffee maker and a computer.
          But, I think I am the first to use hot Java as a cooling method. The
          graph below shows the lineage of coffee maker computers. There are a
          total of 5. In 2002 Nick Pelis built the first ever coffee maker
          computer named

            >The Caffeine Machine</a
          >. Then, the builds went cold for 15 years until 2018, when a person
          named Ali “THE CRE8OR” Abbas collaborated with a company named Zotac
          to make the

          to feature in a trade show. One year after in 2019, a man whose

            >Why is there a 15 year gap between the first coffee maker computer
            and the rest? Were people tired of drinking coffee?</span
          >
          I don't think so. We're people tired of building fun computers? Were
          they distracted? Could they not afford it? I'm not sure. But something
          is wrong. There should be a steady output of absurd coffee maker
          computers being made. What happened in those 15 years? To look into it
          I created the graph above. It shows a timeline of coffee maker
          computers along with important events compiled from the
          <a
            href="https://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/computers/"
            target="_blank"
            >The Timeline of Computer History</a
          >
          from the Computer History Museum. Of course, there are many important
          things that happened worldwide between 2002 and 2018 like war, natural
          disasters, financial crisis, shootings, refugee crisis, and the
          apocalypse in 2012 determined by the end of the Mayan calendar. Its
          too much to capture in this dinky graph. But maybe focusing on tech,
          and the culture of tech, can reveal something about this large gap in
          absurd creativity. Do you see any trends?

          Coffeematic PC inspired an art exhibition called
          <a href="sparklines.html">Sparklines</a>. In Sparklines I elaborate on
          the curious 15 year gap in coffee maker computers being built and
          create data portraits of a group of people I call artist-hackers. The
          work is all drawn by hand using drafting tools and a vintage lettering
          kit. Check it out at the link above! Do you know of any other coffee
          maker computer builds that I missed?
