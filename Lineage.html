          <strong>Description:</strong> 
          
          
          Data Landscapes are a series of seven, hand drafted data visualizations, 
          each containing six lines of data 
          between the years 2000 and 2024 (a period of caffeinated technological growth). With each line, you'll see that 
          the years 2002, 2018, 2019, and 2024 are labeled. These are years when a group I call Artist/Hackers built 
          coffee maker gaming computers. These Artist/Hackers span the years 2002 to 2024, with a curious 15-year gap in their 
          creation. Data landscapes investigate this gap, using publically available social data to understand something about a 
          private and subversive group. <br/><br/>

          Data Landscapes are drawn by hand using techniques that existed before computing tools were available like the t-square, 
          square, rulers, a lettering kit, and shape templates. With a computer, each of these pieces may take 
          20 minutes to create, but here they take between 20 - 30 hours. This is part of an 
          art exhibition called <a href="Sparklines.html">Sparklines</a> where hand-drafted data visualizations 
          accompany a <a href="Coffeematic PC.html">coffee maker computer</a>. <br/><br/>
