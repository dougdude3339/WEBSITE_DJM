          <strong class="label-tag">Description:</strong> I wanted to imagine
          what it'd be like if a George Foreman grill was merged with a personal
          computer, and how it would try to communicate with us. What
          information could it use to describe itself? What are it's behaviors
          and what does it seek to accomplish? Included in this Zine (or User
          Manual) you'll find information about the operation, end user behavior
          preferences, cooking charts, and even recipes for a George Foreman
          Personal Computer. This zine was featured in
