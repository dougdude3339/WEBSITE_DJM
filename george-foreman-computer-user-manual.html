          A user manual for a George Foreman Computer by Doug MacDowell artist
        </h2>

<p>
  <strong class="visually-hidden label-tag">Description:</strong> I wanted to imagine
  what it'd be like if a George Foreman grill merged with a personal
  computer. How would it communicate with the user? What
  information could it use to describe itself? What are it's behaviors
  and what's it supposed to accomplish? Included in this Zine (or User
  Manual) crafted with TESLIN® substrate, you'll find information about the operation, end user behavior
  preferences, cooking charts, and even recipes for a George Foreman Computer.
  This zine was featured in 
  <a href="https://archive.org/details/ephemer-mal-4-single-page/ephemerMAL%204_printable/" target="_blank">
