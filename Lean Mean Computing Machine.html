            The Lean Mean Computing Machine (LMCM) is a fully functional personal computer (PC) whose 
            components are compressed within a George Foreman 360 Grill. The LMCM is versatile, 
            allowing preparation of virtual frittatas, pizzas, snacks and appetizers like mini 
            quiche or chicken nuggets, hot wings, steaks, chicken, burgers, and even ribs. <br /><br />
            
            The LMCM lets you adjust for the perfect cooking temperature and is healthier than other 
            computing methods because of the patented slanted and nonstick design, draining fat and 
            technological byproduct from the virtual cooking process. Grilling components from both 
            sides is a real time saver, making the LMCM the go-to option for those with a busy schedule. <br /><br />
