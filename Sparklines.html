        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Sparklines</span> is an upcoming thesis show by Doug MacDowell (me). This show is a culmination 
            of my Master of Fine Arts degree at Ohio University. The show visualizes data portraits and landscapes, 
            positioned within the lineage of coffee maker computers. The work is multi media and will feature  
            two-dimensional and three-dimensional artwork. <br /><br />

            I am sharing the space with my colleague <strong>Chad Robert Collofello</strong> whose show name is <span class="highlight">Reawaken</span>. Chad's show 
            is profoundly personal and inspired by his journey to rediscover birdsong, 
            a childhood fascination he lost due to hearing impairment and urban noise. 
            <br /><br />            

            The <strong>reception for this show is Friday, April 18, 2025 from 6-8PM at Majestic Galleries in Nelsonville, Ohio.</strong> 
            The address 
            is: 20 Public Square, Nelsonville, OH 45764 <br /><br />


                
            <span class="highlight">I anticipate the reception to be a blast and I happily invite you to join us!</span>              
              <br /><br />

            Nelsonville is a rural town and Majestic Galleries is an elegant and large space. 
            I anticipate to provide food. Because this is a university event, we cannot provide alcohol. But there are bars 
            adjacent to the gallery - I recommend Rhapsody. Athens is also a skip away. I recommend Jackie's Taproom or 
            Little Fish Brewing. <br /><br />
        
            My and Chad's show is open for a total of three days (April 18-20, 2025). For those of you who live far away and have 
            received my postcard or message, please know I will be documenting the artwork and sharing on my website. <br /><br />

            I hope to see you there. If you received a postcard in the mail, in your mailbox, or by hand, thank you. 
            <span class="highlight">I want to especially thank my beautiful fianc√© Alexandra, my Mom, Dad, and Sister, all of my family and 
            soon to be family, and my close friends.</span> Thank you all for your support.
