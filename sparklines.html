        <i>Sparklines</i> was an exhibition featuring hand drafted data
        visualizations like ones made by William Playfair or W.E.B Dubois in the
        1700's and 1800's. The visualizations orbit a coffee maker computer I
        built and named
        <a href="coffeematic-pc.html" target="_blank">Coffeematic PC</a>.
        Coffeematic PC is part of a <i>lineage of coffee maker computers</i>. By
        focusing on this unique lineage of coffee maker computers along with
        public datasets, <i>Sparklines</i> presents <a href="data-portraits.html"target="_blank">data portraits</a> and
        <a href="data-landscapes.html"target="_blank">landscapes</a> to contextualize a subversive
        group I call artist/hackers.
